This was was my first major website reworking project that I was fully in charge of. 
There was a vunerable server that I had put mod_security in front of that ran a 
old web programming langauge called Tango. The company that made it no longer existed,
no one knew how it worked, and basically there was an ftp that people kept 
manually uploading html files to. The template varied greatly, and badly formated 
html was the norm. 

Tasked with moving all the content to a drupal based cms system, I 
trained and managed several temp workers who copied and pasted assets from
the site into drupals cms system. Some time later we had all the content over
and the site is now the flagship of the organization.
