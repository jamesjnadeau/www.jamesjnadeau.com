	<p>I am from Plymouth, VT. Went to high school in Woodstock. Graduated from RPI with a degree in Computer Science and Systems Engineering.</p>
	
	<p>I've created, modified, upgraded, secured and maintained complex I.T. systems
	for large, multinational organizations. A full stack developer and system designer, 
	I can help you tackle your technical problems.<p>
	
	<p>I excel a cleaning up other peoples messes, and hitting deadlines. 
	Third party security tests have been unable to get past the security
	infrasture I use, time and time again. If you need it on time, scalable, and secure, I can come
	through for you</p>
	
	<p>I love Vermont, and am proud to call this state my home. 
	I enjoy football, not for the names, but for the strategy and teamwork 
	required to win. I am currently a high school football referee in Vermont. 
	The pay isn't great, but it's a great excuse to drive around VT in the 
	fall and watch some football. </p>
	
	<p>Sailing is also one of my hobbies. I own a small sunfish sailboat, but 
	am hoping to upgrade soon to something with a cabin. Lake champlain is 
	a hop, skip and a jump away, and all that it has to explore has never let me down. 
	
	<p>The product of a ski bum mother, I enjoy hitting the slopes in the winter 
	when the weather allows. Admittedly, I'm a little spoiled from my upbringing
	and haven't gone much in the past couple of years. </p>
	
	<p>I've owned a computer since the ripe age of 4. A Macintosh SE as a matter 
	of fact. My mother was/is a graphic artist, and it was bought for her. 
	I think we can both agree I got more out of it. I didn't really discover 
	linux until I was about 15 and began throwing it on every old piece of hardware I could muster. </p>
