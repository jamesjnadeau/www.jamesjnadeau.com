I created a directory crawler using ffmpeg that search through hundreds of 
thousands of car videos for wheels tv. I catalogged the data into a database
so they could search and see what they have. 

I extended this with a processor that transcoded the videos into a pre-configured
format into another file location. This allowed them to reconfigure the system to 
fit their changing needs.
