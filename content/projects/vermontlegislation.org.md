## Vermont Legislation App for HackVT 2013

<p>
	For the <a href="http://hackvt.com/">2013 competition</a> I created 
	part of an app(it's not totally done yet) that allows you to look up 
	who your state reps are based upon your current gps coordinates.&nbsp;

<p>To expand upon this, I was going to create a redit like upvote and commenting 
system, but I ran out of patience, and then time.&nbsp;</p><p>This was my 
first excercise combining jQuery Mobile with Backbone.js built on top of a
readbeanphp beancan json-rpc backend. After really digging into the project 
and discovering the recomended way of routing with jQm and backbone wasn't going 
to do what I wanted, and I ended up wasting a lot of time writing my own router. 
It's still has some bugs, but works pretty well considering the time I've invested 
and the time crunch I was under. I hope to get the code up on github soon for 
others to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">In the end, I really enjoyed using 
backbone, and it was impressive how little php I had to write, and how 
fast it makes jQm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
