This was the fist redesign project I was involved with at NGA. I managed and updated
most parts of this website, including retiring bits of it. I set up the
secure payment system for garden research purchases. I helped set up the
ad server that runs the sidebars and helped out with the layout as best I could.

The site is somewhat of a moving target much like the organization. The people 
that took over for me have since moved on as well.
