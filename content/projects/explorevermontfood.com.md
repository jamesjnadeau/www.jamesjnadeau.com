## ExploreVermontFood.com HackVT 2012

<p>I entered in the <a href="http://www.hackvt.com/#details">HackVT 2012</a> 
by myself, the year prior I had a team with 2 designers.</p><p>The end 
result was this:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.explorevermontfood.com/" style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;">explorevermontfood.com</a>
</p>

<p>Basically, given a bunch of open datasets, I was tasked with creating 
an application that would benefit the state of Vermont in some way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I choose to create a restaurant and food sourcing application. I found 
that in rural VT, online listing of these kinds of places was fragmented 
if not scarce. You could find information but it wasn't converged into a 
usable summary that you could make a decision with.&nbsp;</p><p>I used 
<a href="http://querypath.org/">QueryPath</a>&nbsp;to slup up a bunch of 
data from my listed source(wish I could of had more, ran out of time). 
I geocoded my results on import and used that and the browsers geolocation 
to do searches.&nbsp;</p><p>The page I used in my presentation is available below.</p>

<p>I had a blast and can't wait for next year!</p>
